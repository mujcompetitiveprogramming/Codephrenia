You are in a city where each house contains some coins. You have just joined college and have run out of money. You plan to rob the city. The city where you are currently is very modern and was planned in such a way that it can be represented as a NxM matrix where each cell represents a house in the city. Each cell contains an integer Ci ,j denoting the number of coins in that house. 
You are standing at the first row and you plan to steal as much coins as possible. But the cops are after you and you have very little time, so you decide that you will rob only one house in each row and you can move either diagonally to the left or right or the immediate bottom of the current house. You can start from any house in the first row and want to maximize the number of coins you collect.

Input Format

The first line contains two spaced integers N and M denoting the number of rows and rows of columns of the city. 
The next N lines contains M spaced integers denoting Ci,j the number of coins in each house.

Constraints

1 <= N,M <=100 
1 <= Ci,j <= 104

Output Format
