Geek has two strings. Interested in creating unique problems, he assigned positive weights to each letter of the alphabets. 
Now he wants to find the most expensive subsequence.

You are given an array of 26 numbers, denoting the weight of each alphabet. You are also given 2 strings, string X of length N and string Y of length M. You need to print the weight of most expensive subsequence. Weight of subsequence is the sum of weights of all the characters in that subsequence.

Note: subsequence: In mathematics, a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence {A,B,D} is a subsequence of {A,B,C,D,E,F} obtained after removal of elements {C, E and F}. 
The list of all subsequences for the word "apple" would be "a", "ap", "al", "ae", "app", "apl", "ape", "ale", "appl", "appe", "aple", "apple", "p", "pp", "pl", "pe", "ppl", "ppe", "ple", "pple", "l", "le", "e", "".
